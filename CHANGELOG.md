conventional-compat (0.x, so anything may change while pre-1.0).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-30

Initial scaffold (packet `muse-01`). No LLM logic yet — see `AGENTS.md`.

### Added

- `pyproject.toml` managed by uv; runtime deps `fastapi`, `uvicorn`; dev group
  `pytest`, `httpx`, `anyio`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`. `uv.lock` committed.
- `src/muse/main.py` — `create_app()` application factory (no module-level
  singleton; `uvicorn --factory muse.main:create_app`).
- `GET /healthz` → `{"status":"ok"}`. Liveness checks nothing on purpose.
- `GET /readyz` → `{"status":"ok","checks":{"db":"skipped"}}`. The `checks` map
  and its `db` slot are reserved for the Phase 4 credentials vault, so later
  packets fill in a value instead of reshaping the response.
- `tests/` — 23 tests written before the implementation, driven in-process over
  `httpx.ASGITransport` (no socket, no network). Covers probe status codes and
  exact JSON shapes, app-factory isolation, and the 404/405 surface.
- 100% branch-coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=100`) plus strict markers and
  strict config.
- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage, `python:3.14-slim`, uv 0.12.20, non-root runtime
  user, `HEALTHCHECK`, frozen lockfile install.
- `docker-compose.yml`, `bin/prime` (the gate), `mise.toml` (python + uv pins),
  `.python-version`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and a `cafaye.yml`
  manifest draft.

### Notes

- Dependency floors are the newest releases that satisfy the machine-wide
  uv `exclude-newer = "7 days"` supply-chain quarantine, so fastapi 0.141.1 and
  uvicorn 0.53.0 may trail the true latest. See the Dependencies section of
  `AGENTS.md`.
- `cafaye.yml` is a draft: `core` owns the schema and does not exist yet.
